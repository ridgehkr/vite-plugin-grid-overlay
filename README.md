# vite-plugin-grid-overlay

A simple Vite plugin that injects a design grid overlay during development. Useful for aligning elements to a consistent grid when building layouts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# with pnpm
pnpm add -D vite-plugin-grid-overlay

# or with npm
npm install -D vite-plugin-grid-overlay
```

Add the plugin to your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import gridOverlay from 'vite-plugin-grid-overlay'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    gridOverlay({
      gridColor: 'rgba(255,0,0,0.2)',
      columns: 12,
      columnWidth: 80,
      totalWidth: 1280,
      zIndex: 9999,
    }),
  ],
})
```

Press **`Alt + g`** during development to toggle the grid on and off.

## üî® Development
